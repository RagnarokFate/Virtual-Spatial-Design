# Virtual Spatial Design (VSD)

Virtual Spatial Design, also known as VSD, is a project developed in the Computer Graphics Laboratory. It leverages geometric comprehension and full algebraic functionality to render scenes in real-time. The primary aim of the project is to facilitate interior designing through various functionalities such as PushPull+, Mesh Model Transformation, Scalping Mesh Model, Texture Mapping, Lighting and Shading, among others.

## Project Overview

- **PushPull+**: Enables interactive manipulation of objects by pushing and pulling vertices or surfaces.
- **Mesh Model Transformation**: Allows users to transform mesh models, altering their shape, size, or orientation.
- **Scalping Mesh Model**: Provides tools for refining the details of mesh models, enhancing their visual quality.
- **Texture Mapping**: Supports the application of textures onto surfaces, enhancing realism and visual appeal.
- **Lighting and Shading**: Implements lighting models and shading techniques to simulate realistic lighting conditions and material appearances.

## Using Unity with Visual Studio 2022
